Machine learning is one of those fuzzy topics that gets thrown around a lot as
a silver bullet. But... what the heck is it? Zach Miller, a senior data
scientist as Metis, is going to take a stab at demystifying it. He'll
introduce the concept of pattern recognition in data, what to do when your
data gets to big for humans to read, and how machine learning can solve some
of your problems. He'll also spend some time showing you machine learning in action, demonstrating the
power of analytical decision making (without getting into all the the math),
and talking about how machine learning can help save lives and dollars.
